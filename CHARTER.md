## Etiquette
1. Be respectful

    If nothing else, be a fellow human.

1. Be helpful

    We are all trying to improve. That involves hearing from you, but also hearing from everyone. If you don't give feedback, you aren't helping your fellow members. However, there is no one "best" or "complete" feedback that negates others' observations, even from a SME.

1. Your code is your code
    
    You are not required to make all or any changes that come up. At the end of the day the you are requesting feedback, not necessarily PRs or signing up new co-authors.

1. Your tools are your tools

    Similarly, a club is not trying to homogenize development processes. Trying out other's code may require trying out new tools, and that's a good thing, but it does not mean you have to adopt them. When not required by the project, feel free to use your own tools and workflows. Be considerate about how much setup or foreign environments you are forcing on reviewers.


## Establishing a new Club
As a new club leader, all scheduling, formats, and rules are under your discretion. This all is a guid to help you get started, and continue running a club. But you are not beholden to anything written here, although I would encourage you to minimally follow the etiquette.
* Choose a **core competency**
  * This is intended to center the types of projects reviewed, and guide selection of new members. It shouldn't be too specific, just enough that members don't have to learn something new at every meet just to be helpful. It sould probably include at least one programming language everyone can read. You might want to choose the core competency during the first meet. 
* Promote diversity
  * When possible, promote including members of diverse life and work backgrounds. While sticking to the core competencies, try to include members with different experiences and expertises.
* Keep the right size
  * Don't have more members than can rotate as host once per year. There is also probably a size that is too small, but that would seem to depend on the member's personality and code proliferation. If members want to leave, or find a new club, be okay with that. Engaged members make for better meets. We will try to help with this.
