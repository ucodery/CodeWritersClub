# Code Writers Club
A code writers club is a group of individuals that meet regularly to review each
other's code projects. They provide a support group that encourage continuing
development of many programming skills. It is also perhaps an opportunity unique
to writers of code to be able to put a face to their users and to have an open
discussion
