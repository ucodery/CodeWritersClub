# Code Writers Club
A code writers club is a group of individuals that meet regularly to review each
other's code projects. They provide a support group that encourage continuing
development of many programming skills. It is also perhaps an opportunity unique
to writers of open source code to be able to put a face to their users and
recieve open feedback.

## Joining
If you would like to be a part of one of these clubs, or are interested in
starting a new club, [open a new member issue](../../issues/new?labels=new+member&template=new-member-request.yml&title=Request+to+join+from+%3CUSER%3E).

## Goals
Participating in one of these clubs is meant to help you hone your coding skills.
First and foremost writing, since this is a writers club, but also reading,
designing, testing, and all the other skills involved in writing code. This is
done through practice: repitition and iteration based on honest feedback given by
your peers. Along the way you will hopefully learn new skills new techniques and
even new intuitions, and share with others what you know.
